SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(danceability), AVG(valence) FROM songs;

The way Iâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener is that the argument is not comprehensive enough,
might be this listener prefer to a specific artists or this listener prefer to specific genre like Anime or sth, so the avg of 3 arguments,
AVG(energy), AVG(danceability), AVG(valence) might not be very representative of the listener.

If can take artists, tempo, speechiness into consideration might be a good way.
